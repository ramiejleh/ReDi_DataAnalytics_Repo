In your most recent experiment you mixed two different gases. The chemical reaction made the temperature in the reaction tube vary over time, which was measured with 3 different thermometers. You're now back in your office and ready to analyse your data, which is available in a csv file\n",

If you don't understand some questions or need help, please ask for help in the Slack channel or ping one of the teachers directly.\n",

To improve the likelihood that she'll have a look to see if there's something wrong with the temperature sensors you'll plan to create a nice slide deck.

Make sure that you specify the path correctly and check if you're able to open the created file. Does the visualisation look good?"
